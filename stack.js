// Create two functions that implement:
    // Stack with SLL
    // Queue with SLL

  // Notes:
      // Make notes about implementing each with an array...two or three lines about each
          Why is the SLL version better
      // Pay attention to how the push, pop and peek functions included in the SLL versions
           are different fromt the original SLL versions
